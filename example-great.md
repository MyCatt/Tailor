As a Finance and Operations application user, I'd approach the software update notes with a focus on how these changes can impact our work, improve efficiencies, or involve adjustments to our current workflows. Here's a revised version of the document from that perspective:

Platform Update Highlights for Finance and Operations Apps Version 10.0.25 (April 2022)

The latest update, version 10.0.25, of Finance and Operations apps has rolled out, bringing in a suite of new features designed to streamline processes and enhance user experience. Below are some significant updates and their availability timeline:

Preview of Release: January 2022
General Availability of Release (Self-update): March 2022
General Availability of Release (Auto-update): April 2022
Enhancements to Note:

Priority-based Scheduling for Batch Jobs: Transitioning from the traditional method, this feature allows for setting priorities for batch groups instead of assigning specific batch servers. This could significantly optimize the way we manage and execute batch jobs, ensuring that critical tasks get priority.

Vertically Scrolling Workspaces: Workspaces have been visually upgraded to support vertical scrolling, promising a more seamless navigation and overview of data on one page. This could greatly improve how we monitor and interact with critical business intelligence at a glance.

Upgrade of jQuery UI to 1.13.0: Keeping up with open-source standards, this technical upgrade may not directly impact daily operations for most users but ensures better security and compatibility with new web standards.

Saved Views for Dialogs and Workspaces: Enhanced personalization options now allow saved views for dialogs and, in preview, workspaces too. This feature can tailor screens to better suit individual workflow requirements, potentially boosting productivity.

Improved Sorting Support for Grouped Grids: An adjustment that leaves the grouping of data in grids intact while sorting. This could simplify data analysis tasks and reporting by making it easier to organize and view data according to specific criteria without disrupting existing groupings.

Developer-focused Features: A couple of updates have been provided for developers, including options to opt-out individual grids from asynchronous behavior and better support for custom filters with saved views. While more behind-the-scenes, these adjustments can have far-reaching effects on the customization and efficiency of your apps.

Availability and Deployment: The new features will be rolled out in stages, with a preview available in January 2022, followed by self-update options in March and broader auto-update releases in April.

Adopting The New Features: While the platform automatically updates, leveraging these new features might require visiting the Feature Management workspace. Itâ€™s an opportune time to review these updates and plan for their integration into your daily operations, ensuring you fully benefit from the latest enhancements.

I encourage my fellow Finance and Operations professionals to dive into these updates, explore how they can be integrated into your workflows, and share any insights or questions you might have. Let's make the most out of our finance and operations applications together!
